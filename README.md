# Real time bus tracker (about)
In this project I created a program that tracks the MTA bus in real time. I was able to complete this project using mapbox, and MBTA API. 

## How to run
Simply load the index.html file and click on the click to track button the on top left corner.

## Things to improve in future
I'd like to add a box where users can input specific bus they want to track. Also i'd like to work on the styling such as the icon, map style, which bus stop it's heading, etc.
